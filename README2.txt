# React + Vite...

I created this app as follows:
bash
npm create vite@latest react-task-tracker -- --template react
Then, follow the instructions to install dependencies and start the development server:
bash
cd react-task-tracker
npm install
npm run dev

To run Vite server from bash window
npm run dev
the App will show in... http://localhost:5173/

To run Json Server open a second bash window and
npm run server

http://localhost:3001/tasks... to make calls to this db.json file
